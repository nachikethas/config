# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
bind s split-window -v
bind v split-window -h

# move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 1
bind > resize-pane -R 1
bind - resize-pane -D 1
bind + resize-pane -U 1

# bind : to command-prompt like vim
# this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt

# vi-style controls for copy mode
setw -g mode-keys vi

# Unbind Ctrl-b to something more finger friendly.
# Update: Screen uses Ctrl-a, which is
# annoying if you are logged into a remote inside tmux.
unbind C-b
set -g prefix C-a

## Adapt the title bar to the server that you connect to
#set -g set-titles on
#set -g set-titles-string "#T"

# mouse-select-pane [on | off]
#    If on, tmux captures the mouse and when a window is
#    split into multiple panes the mouse may be used to
#    select the current pane.  The mouse click is also
#    passed through to the application as normal.
#set -g mouse-select-pane on

# Use 256 colors in tmux
set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"

# Move status bar to the top
set-option -g status-position top

# Make renames persistent
set-option -g allow-rename off

# Color (tmuxline.vim)
if-shell "test -f ~/.tmuxline" "source ~/.tmuxline"

# Display CPU and Memory in the status bar
# https://github.com/thewtex/tmux-mem-cpu-load
set -g status-interval 2
set -g status-right "#S #(tmux-mem-cpu-load --powerline-right --interval 2)#[default]"
set -g status-right-length 60
